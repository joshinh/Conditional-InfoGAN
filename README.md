# Conditional-InfoGAN

This is the course project for the Advanced Machine Learning Course (CS726) at IIT Bombay. The initial code has been adapted from https://github.com/ratschlab/RGAN. 

The command used to train conditional InfoGAN on the synthetic dataset is :

`python3 experiment.py --settings_file sine_cond_c3_1-5_0.1-0.9_pi`

The saved weights used to generate the plots are available in RGAN_info/experiments/data and the best plots are in RGAN_info/experiments/plots_info.
